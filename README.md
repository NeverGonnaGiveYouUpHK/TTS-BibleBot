# Fast TTS Bible Bot

A Discord bot to recite the Holy Bible in your voice chats (and more)!

Add the bot to your Discord server with this link (you'll need the manage server permission for that!): https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=815255620948983848&permissions=3271744&scope=bot

To list all available features, send '+help' (without quotes) into chat. You need to type all commands to a server text channel - DM's are ignored by the bot!

The bot will work right away. If something breaks with TTS, it is most likely just an another Google's anti-bot measure, so please, contact us and we'll attempt to fix the issue again.

When it comes to APIs, it combines the Discord API (in general + voice) and Google Translate TTS API (sending the output straight into voice!).

Bible texts were taken from https://worldenglish.bible/
